For this project we used PHP, mySQL, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

If you would like to run this, first you need to download a few things.
1) This respository had all the code you'll need for the front-end as well as most of the PHP stuff.
2) Xampp to run a DataBase so the website's PHP can run thru it.
3) Atom or anykind of text editor to make changes yourself.

In the files provided by this repo, there's a particular file called "bdh.inc.php" in file there are some variable that you have to match inside your localhost/phpMyAdmin destination. Open Xampp control panel and start Apache and mySQL.
Inside your web-browser's address bar type "localhost/phpMyAdmin" it's take you the location needed to create a database for the site to use.
Before we create the database table's first we need to create and admin user so that the site can use it to access data from the database.
Make sure the username and password match the information listed in "dbh.inc.php"
Once that's complete, Create a new database with the name "FuzzyFeat" / copy and paste the information from "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nnbSttNXJuT_mV1Swin7HtMellSrrdTln2B_mpy0A30/edit" (everything after line 1) to the sql tab listed in the newly created database.
This information will create the structure of the database by creating "Charaters, Quizzes, Answers, Users"
Next use "https://docs.google.com/document/d/10SUotuF2kloQ3GUbrnk_RbvJq6l17llT1ctJGlenYOE/edit" (everything between line 15 to the end of page 7) to populate the characters into the character database.
Now that the database stuff is done, you can leave and visit the site. Type "Localhost/FuzzyFeat" into the address bar and it should take you there.
Create a User under the "Sign Up" tab to allow for the creation of quizzes.
Create a quiz and see it appear in your profile page.
Dont forget to have fun!
